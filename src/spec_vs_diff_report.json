  "summary": "Diff adds a Motoko backend actor with mod and library models plus authorization mixin, and a React/TanStack Router frontend with Explore, Mod Details, My Library (auth-gated), and About/Disclaimer pages. It also adds Internet Identity auth hooks/UI, a profile setup modal, lime-on-charcoal theme variables, and references to generated logo/hero assets. Some key backend and asset verification is limited due to truncation/omitted files.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Backend exposes query methods to list mods and fetch a mod by id/slug; exposes authenticated methods to add/remove/list a user’s saved mods.",
      "reason": "Frontend calls actor methods (getAllMods, getMod, getMyLibrary, addToLibrary, removeFromLibrary), but backend/main.mo is truncated before showing these method definitions, so their existence/signatures cannot be confirmed from the provided diff summary.",

      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "At least 8 sample mods exist with varied tags and descriptions seeded in the backend.",
      "reason": "Only three seeded mods are visible in the truncated backend snippet; additional seed entries may exist beyond the truncation but are not evidenced in the diff summary.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-7",
      "requirement": "Generated images exist in frontend/public/assets/generated (logo + hero) and are referenced directly by the frontend.",
      "reason": "Frontend references the expected asset paths, but the actual image files under frontend/public/assets/generated are not shown in the diff summary (some files were omitted), so existence cannot be verified from the provided evidence.",
